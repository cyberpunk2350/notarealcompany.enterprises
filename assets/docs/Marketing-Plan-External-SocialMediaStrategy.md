**Confidential – External Use Allowed (Mostly)**

---

## Overview

The NARC Marketing Department proudly presents our **cutting-edge**, **totally serious**, and **mildly chaotic** Social Media Strategy for external audiences. Our goal is to confuse competitors, entertain shareholders, and make employees feel like they’re “trending.”

## Objectives

1. Increase followers by 42% (because numbers look impressive).  
2. Post at least 3 memes per workday to maintain authenticity.  
3. Encourage engagement without actually answering questions.  
4. Make the brand look futuristic and vaguely dystopian.

## Channels

- **Twitter / X:**  
  Post cryptic motivational quotes like: *“The server smiles upon those who reboot.”*  

- **LinkedIn:**  
  Publish serious-sounding updates with lots of buzzwords. *Synergy, Innovation, Paradigm Shift.*  

- **Instagram:**  
  Share office snacks, blurred server racks, and the occasional cat GIF.  

- **TikTok:**  
  Optional. Only approved if a dancing server mascot is involved.

## Content Guidelines

- Use **#CorporateCyberpunk** in every post.  
- Avoid spelling mistakes unless it’s ironic.  
- Employees must appear to have fun, but fun must not interfere with work.  

---

## Metrics for Success

- Likes, shares, retweets, and other socially quantified dopamine metrics.  
- At least one viral post per quarter (bonus points if it involves a mascot).  
- Competitor confusion score above 7/10.
