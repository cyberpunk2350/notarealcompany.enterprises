**Confidential / External**

## Executive Summary

2023 was another “fantastic” year for NARC, marked by unprecedented levels of paperwork, slightly elevated caffeine consumption, and one mysterious server outage that nobody wants to talk about.

## Key Financial Highlights

- **Revenue:** $42,000,000 (approximate, may include rounding errors)
- **Expenses:** $39,500,000 (including glitter pens and motivational posters)
- **Profit:** $2,500,000 (enough to buy a small island or several ergonomic chairs)
- **Budget Variance:** +3% (mostly due to unplanned donut orders)

---

## Department Notes

- **Accounting:** Continues to invent creative ways to reconcile the impossible.
- **Payroll:** Everyone got paid, except for that one intern who keeps hiding in the server room.
- **Investments:** Currently heavily invested in “Projects That Sound Cool But Are Still Conceptual.”

## Goals for 2024

1. Automate at least 10% of manual form stamping.
2. Increase profit margins by persuading employees to work 5 extra minutes per week.
3. Introduce “Fun Financial Fridays” (mandatory attendance for happiness officer approval).
