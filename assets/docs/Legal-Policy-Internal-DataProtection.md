# NARC Legal Department – Internal Data Protection Policy

**Confidential – Internal Use Only**  

---

## Purpose

To ensure that all employees comply with our highly official, extremely serious, and totally enforceable Data Protection Policy (DPP™), while occasionally pretending to understand what “GDPR” really means.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to all NARC employees, contractors, interns, and anyone who accidentally walks into the server room.

---

## Policy Statements

1. **Data Classification**  
   - All data shall be classified as **Top Secret**, **Kinda Important**, or **Probably Fine**.  
   - Never label anything as “Completely Useless” even if it is.

2. **Access Control**  
   - Only employees with badge access may enter restricted areas.  
   - Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and impossible to remember.  

3. **Data Handling**  
   - Do not share confidential files with external parties, unless they bribe you with donuts.  
   - Always double-check the “To:” field before hitting send.  

4. **Breach Response**  
   - If a breach occurs, immediately notify your manager and then quickly hide any evidence of your existence.  
   - Document the incident in the official “Oops Log” for audit purposes.

## Responsibilities

- **Employees:** Follow the DPP™ and look very serious when auditors are present.  
- **IT Department:** Encrypt everything, forget the passwords, then pretend nothing happened.  
- **Legal Department:** Nod sagely at meetings and say “We’ll review the policy.”

## Enforcement

Non-compliance may result in a sternly worded email, a passive-aggressive meeting, or, in extreme cases, a mild scolding.
