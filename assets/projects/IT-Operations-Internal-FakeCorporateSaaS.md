# Fake Corporate SaaS (HR, Tickets, Intranet)

**Department:** IT Operations  
**Category:** Internal  

## Overview
A fully functional, yet entirely fake SaaS environment. Includes HR, Ticketing, and Intranet dashboards designed to look impressively official while serving no real corporate purpose.

## Features
- **HR Module:** Onboarding, PTO tracking, and imaginary performance reviews.  
- **Ticketing System:** Automatically generates fun error messages and memos with cryptic compliance warnings.  
- **Intranet Dashboard:** Central hub for lab news, memos, and Alpha Complex-style bureaucratic announcements.

## Notes
- All user accounts are simulated; no real data is used.  
- Compliance Bot occasionally issues playful warnings to “keep morale high.”  
- Designed to train lab members in SaaS-style workflows without real-world consequences.

## TODO
- Add mock analytics dashboard with KPI humor metrics.  
- Integrate optional “mandatory fun” notifications for team members.  
- Extend dashboard to support inter-lab collaboration in the VPN mesh.
