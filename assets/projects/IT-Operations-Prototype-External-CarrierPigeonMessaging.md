# Carrier-Pigeon-Based Low-Latency Messaging (Experimental)

**Department:** IT Operations  
**Category:** Prototype  

## Overview
An experimental messaging system using trained carrier pigeons to deliver lab communications with surprisingly low latency. Fully compliant with NARC’s “fun first, efficiency second” motto.

## Features
- Pigeons carry encrypted microSD cards with messages.  
- Dashboard tracks pigeons’ flight paths and message delivery stats.  
- Optional emoji payloads for morale and status updates.

## Notes
- Works best in open-air lab courtyards.  
- Compliance Bot occasionally issues gentle warnings about bird handling.  
- Happiness Officer recommends treats for pigeons to maintain optimal performance.

## TODO
- Test inter-lab routing across VPN mesh for hybrid delivery.  
- Integrate performance KPIs into the main lab dashboard.  
- Add automatic “mission accomplished” notifications for lab personnel.
