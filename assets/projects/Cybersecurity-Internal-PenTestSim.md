# Penetration Testing Simulation

**Department:** Cybersecurity  
**Category:** Internal  

## Overview
This project simulates penetration testing across all lab systems. No real production servers are harmed, and all “attacks” are approved by the Happiness Officer.  

## Simulation Features
- Mock phishing campaigns that send motivational quotes instead of malware.  
- Firewall breach drills with snack rewards for successful detection.  
- Packet-sniffing exercises conducted by ferrets (trained by Alex Firewall).  

## Notes
- Results are logged in the "Highly Classified Fun Reports" folder.  
- Compliance Bot will issue gentle warnings for incorrect PPE usage.  
- The simulation occasionally triggers spontaneous dance breaks.  

## TODO
- Expand coverage to include imaginary IoT devices.  
- Automate report generation with subtle sarcasm.  
- Introduce surprise vulnerability scenarios that challenge the Happiness Officer.
