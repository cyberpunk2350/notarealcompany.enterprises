# Internal VPN Mesh Deployment

**Department:** IT Operations  
**Category:** Internal  

## Overview
A full-scale VPN mesh connecting all lab sites. Encryption is “state-of-the-art” and occasionally checks in with a carrier pigeon for redundancy.

## Highlights
- Servers are named after classic movie characters.  
- Mondays are unsupported; the VPN refuses to cooperate.  
- Logs include emoji for morale tracking.

## TODO
- Automate patching with motivational banner messages.  
- Experiment with low-latency messaging via carrier pigeons.  
- Conduct mock incident response drills for fun.
