# Internal VPN Mesh Deployment

**Department:** IT Operations  
**Category:** Internal  

## Overview
This project implements a full-scale homelab VPN mesh across all lab locations. Connections are fully encrypted using “totally real” ciphers and occasionally handshakes with a carrier pigeon for redundancy.

## Notes
- Servers have been named after classic movie characters.  
- Mondays are not supported; our VPN dislikes them.  
- The Happiness Officer insists on emoji logs in every connection attempt.  

## TODO
- Automate patching scripts to send motivational quotes via VPN banner.  
- Test carrier-pigeon low-latency messaging.  
- Conduct a mock incident response for fun.
