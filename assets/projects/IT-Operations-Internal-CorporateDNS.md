# Corporate DNS + AdGuard Deployment

**Department:** IT Operations  
**Category:** Internal  

## Overview
A corporate-style DNS infrastructure paired with AdGuard for ad-blocking, safe browsing, and general homelab chaos reduction. Designed to make browsing in the lab feel surprisingly professional.

## Features
- Centralized DNS for internal lab networks.  
- AdGuard provides ad-blocking, tracker protection, and occasional motivational banners.  
- Mock reporting dashboard shows “DNS efficiency” and “Happy Packets” metrics.

## Notes
- All lab devices are configured automatically, including IoT and experimental coffee machines.  
- Compliance Bot occasionally injects fun warning messages in logs.  
- Happiness Officer insists on emoji in DNS logs for morale.

## TODO
- Expand to external lab connections via VPN mesh.  
- Add optional carrier-pigeon alert system for DNS outages.  
- Document whimsical edge cases in a memo.
